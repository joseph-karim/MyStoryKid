## üí° **Key Architectural Decisions Made**

1. **Database-First Approach**: All data persisted in PostgreSQL with proper relationships
2. **Anonymous-First UX**: Users can create books without signing up
3. **Real-Time Pricing**: Dynamic pricing based on actual book specifications
4. **Microservice Architecture**: Separate services for different concerns
5. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works, enhanced features layer on top

---

## üéâ **What Makes This Special**

MyStoryKid now has a **production-grade foundation** with:
- **Intelligent pricing** that adapts to book specifications
- **Seamless user experience** from anonymous to authenticated
- **Real-time integration** with print and e-commerce services
- **Scalable architecture** that can handle growth
- **Data integrity** with proper database design

The missing pieces are primarily **operational** (emails, webhooks) rather than **architectural**, meaning the foundation is solid and ready for production deployment with the right operational support.
