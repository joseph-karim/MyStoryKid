# MyStoryKid - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary
MyStoryKid is a web application that enables parents to create personalized children's storybooks featuring their own children as the main characters. The application uses AI to generate stories and illustrations based on user inputs, child photos, and selected art styles. The goal is to provide a complete end-to-end experience from story creation to purchasing digital downloads or printed books.

## Current State
The application currently has:
- Multi-step wizard for book creation (category, character details, art style, characters, story details)
- Character creation with photo upload and AI-generated style previews
- OpenAI integration for story generation and image editing
- Basic anonymous authentication flow
- Placeholder payment integration with Shopify and Lulu
- PDF generation capabilities
- Partial book generation with image creation

## Key Gaps Identified
1. **Multiple Children Support**: Currently focused on single child, needs ability to add siblings/other children
2. **User Experience**: Missing loading states, progress indicators, and clear timing expectations
3. **Story Randomization**: No quick-start option to auto-generate story elements
4. **Authentication**: Account creation flow not integrated into book creation process
5. **Payment Integration**: Checkout and payment processing not fully implemented
6. **Security**: API keys exposed on client side, need server-side edge functions
7. **User Dashboard**: No way to view saved books, order history, or shipment tracking
8. **Image Consistency**: Character preview images not used as references during book generation
