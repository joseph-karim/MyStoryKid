# OpenAI Migration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to migrate the application from using multiple image generation services (Segmind and Dzine) to exclusively using OpenAI for all image generation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Service Files
- Deleted `src/services/segmindService.js`
- Deleted `src/services/dzineService.js`

### 2. Created Utility Files
- Created `src/utils/styleUtils.js` to handle style-related functions previously in dzineService

### 3. Updated Components
- Updated `src/components/wizard/GenerateBookStep.jsx` to use styleUtils instead of dzineService
- Updated `src/components/wizard/SummaryStep.jsx` to use styleUtils instead of dzineService
- Updated `src/components/CharacterWizard.jsx` to remove dzineService imports and use only OpenAI
- Updated `src/components/wizard/GeneratingStep.jsx` to remove segmindService imports
- Updated `src/components/wizard/ArtStyleStep.jsx` to use styleUtils and remove fetchDzineStyles

### 4. Style Handling
- Moved style code mapping from dzineService to styleUtils
- Created utility functions for style name formatting

## Benefits
- Simplified codebase by using a single image generation service
- Improved consistency in image generation
- Reduced dependencies on external services
- Better character consistency throughout stories

## Next Steps
- Consider adding more OpenAI-specific features like:
  - Image variations for character poses
  - Inpainting for specific scene modifications
  - More detailed style guidance for consistent art style
- Update style preview images to match OpenAI's generation capabilities
