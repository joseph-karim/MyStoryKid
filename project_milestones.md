# Project Milestones & Goals

## Project Overview

MyStoryKid is a web application designed to allow users to create personalized children's stories. It features a multi-step wizard interface where users can define story parameters, characters, and art styles. The application leverages AI APIs, specifically the Dzine API, for generating stylized character images and potentially other creative elements.

## Key Goals

*   Provide a user-friendly wizard experience for creating personalized children's books.
*   Successfully integrate with the Dzine AI API for generating character images based on user photos or descriptions and selected art styles.
*   Ensure accurate mapping and usage of Dzine API art styles.
*   Implement robust validation and state management throughout the creation wizard.
*   Resolve bugs related to API integration, including style code mismatches, character preview generation failures, and API rate limiting.
*   Generate complete children's books with AI-generated text and images on a page-by-page basis.

## Development Phases/Milestones (Inferred)

1.  **Initial Setup:** Basic project structure, routing, and core UI components.
2.  **Wizard Flow Implementation:** Creation of the multi-step wizard interface (`CategoryStep`, `CharacterStep` (Child details), `ArtStyleStep`, `CharactersStep` (Book characters), `StoryDetailsStep`, `SummaryStep`). Basic state management setup (`useBookStore`).
3.  **Dzine API Integration (Styles):**
    *   Implemented `dzineService.js` to fetch style lists.
    *   Added style selection UI in `ArtStyleStep.jsx`.
    *   Debugged style code mismatches between local mappings and API reality.
    *   Implemented `analyzeAllStyles` for better debugging.
4.  **Dzine API Integration (Image Generation):**
    *   Implemented `CharacterWizard.jsx` component for defining characters and triggering image generation (`createImg2ImgTask`, `createTxt2ImgTask`).
    *   Integrated polling logic (`getTaskProgress`) to retrieve generated images.
    *   Passed selected `artStyleCode` from the main wizard state into `CharacterWizard`.
5.  **Wizard Logic & Validation Refinement:**
    *   Addressed issues with assigning the `role: 'main'` to the initially created character.
    *   Fixed state synchronization bugs in `CharactersStep.jsx` causing validation errors.
    *   Resolved build errors related to incorrect image asset paths.
    *   Implemented protection against rapid API retries causing rate-limiting errors.
6.  **Book Generation Implementation:**
    *   Created new `GenerateBookStep.jsx` component to handle the book generation process.
    *   Implemented two-step generation process using OpenAI:
        1. Page outline generation (complete story structure)
        2. Page-by-page text and image prompt generation
    *   Integrated Dzine API for image generation based on prompts.
    *   Added routing from `SummaryStep` to `GenerateBookStep`.
    *   Implemented loading states and progress indicators during generation.
    *   Created book preview interface showing text and generated images for each page.
7.  **(Future):** Further feature development, adding more story elements, refining error handling, potentially adding more AI integrations.
